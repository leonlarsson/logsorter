			<h2>Changelog</h2>
			<u><b><a title="Click to see how it looked." href="../assets/images/May_11_2021_Pic.png">Oct 25,
						2021</a></b></u>
			<u><b><a title="Click to experience it." href="../old/v7.5">(Version 7.5)</a></b></u>
			<br>
			- Cleaned up and freshened some code. Nothing visual. Hopefully broke nothing.
			<br>
			- Added a preload spinny thing to prevent flickering.


			<br><br>
			<u><b><a title="Click to see how it looked." href="../assets/images/May_11_2021_Pic.png">May 11,
						2021</a></b></u>
			<u><b><a title="Click to experience it." href="../old/v7">(Version 7)</a></b></u>
			<br>
			- Added light mode. It defaults to your system preference, but can be selected manually in the top left
			corner. Dark mode was also... darkened in a few areas.
			<br>
			- Added debug/extra options. Double click "Log Sorter" or the | between the Load/Save buttons to toggle
			debug
			mode. Comes with some extra options.
			<br>
			- Added a way to share all current settings. Can be found in the Debug settings. Example <a
				href="../?bot=99&start=%28thanks%20for%20clicking%20%3C3%29&newlines=true&verbose=true">here</a>.
			<br>
			- The Input textbox now also has numbered lines.
			<br>
			- Added an option to scroll to the bottom (or Verbose if used with newlines) of the textbox on parse.
			<br>
			- Changed the button order and colors to make a bit more sense. Green to start, Blue to alter, Red to clear.
			<br>
			- The website should now be more mobile (and small screen) friendly, stacking the textboxes vertically when
			at a certain width. Won't be perfect for all devices, of course.
			<br>
			- Some backend work with how IDs are counted and such.


			<br><br>
			<u><b><a title="Click to see how it looked." href="../assets/images/Apr_10_2021_Pic.png">Apr 10,
						2021</a></b></u>
			<u><b><a title="Click to experience it." href="../old/v6">(Version 6)</a></b></u>
			<br>
			- Added the option to only output unique IDs. Effectively a duplication check.
			<br>
			- Removing duplicates now takes "Newlines" and "Verbose" options into account and now works fully as
			intended.
			<br>
			- Rewrote and optimized a lot of code handling sorting and most functions, resulting in <b>a lot</b> quicker
			and more efficient sorting speeds. Previously, matching 9K lines took over 2 seconds. Now, 170K takes 1
			second.

			<br><br>
			<u><b><a title="Click to see how it looked." href="../assets/images/Mar_24_2021_Pic.png">Mar 24,
						2021</a></b></u>
			<u><b><a title="Click to experience it." href="../old/v5">(Version 5)</a></b></u>
			<br>
			- Added ability to match against multiple starting numbers. Useful if the target accounts vary in age.
			<br>
			- Added some more styling to input boxes.
			<br>
			- Made changes to the File Upload method and changed some under-the-hood things. Uploading a file will now
			populate the Input textbox.
			<br>
			- Removed the check (and annoying alert) for empty starting IDs in favor of placeholder text.

			<br><br>
			<u><b><a title="Click to see how it looked." href="../assets/images/Jan_30_2021_Pic.png">Jan 30,
						2021</a></b></u>
			<u><b><a title="Click to experience it." href="../old/v4">(Version 4)</a></b></u>
			<br>
			- Added ability to split the results into groups of x amount. This only works when using newlines. Please
			remove duplicates before splitting for the best effect.

			<br><br>
			<u><b><a title="Click to see how it looked." href="../assets/images/Jan_29_2021_Pic.png">Jan 29,
						2021</a></b></u>
			<u><b><a title="Click to experience it." href="../old/v3.5">(Version 3.5)</a></b></u>
			<br>
			- Added numbered lines to the Output textbox.
			<br>
			- Added some nicer scrollbars.
			<br>
			- Stonks.

			<br><br>
			<u><b><a title="Click to see how it looked." href="../assets/images/Jan_24_2021_Pic.png">Jan 24,
						2021</a></b></u>
			<u><b><a title="Click to experience it." href="../old/v3">(Version 3)</a></b></u>
			<br>
			- Added ability to use custom RegEx. You can select it in "Select RegEx".
			<br>
			- Added a second textbox that can be used as a complete replacement for uploading a file. Simply paste the
			logs and
			press "Match Input".
			<br>
			- Added status text (left of "Output") that shows you if it's working and how many matches were found.
			<br>
			- Also added the stats of "Remove duplicates" to the status text above.
			<br>
			- Fixed some code related to file checks.
			<br>
			- Changed various text, tooltips and styling.
			<br>
			- Did my best to scale the website depending on window size.
